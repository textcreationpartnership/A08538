            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Coſmographie doth deſcribe the world, that is to ſay the heauen; &amp; what els is conteyned within the circuit thereof. For the world is deuyded into heauenly &amp; elementarie regions.</p>
            <p>The celeſtial or heauenly doth conteyne 8 diſtinct Orbes of ſtarres, of which the ſeauen former and neereſt to the earth are atributed to the ſeauen planets, and the greater of theſe doth alwayes conteyne circularly the leſſer, &amp; euery one of theſe doth carry about one only ſtar or planet, but the eigth otherwiſe named the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; conteyneth in it all the other ſtarres which are called fixed.</p>

                     <p>The ſecond parte of the Ile is <hi>Valle di Mazzara</hi> and in it is the cittie of <hi>Palermo</hi> &amp; therein the vice-Roy for the King of Spaine with moſte of the Nobilitie reſideth there is a plaine or ſpatious place, where <hi>Conſtanza Normanna</hi> was deliuered of <hi>Frederyk</hi> the ſecond, vnder a pauilion, &amp; vvould ſo bee deliuered &amp; not in any hovvs becauſe it ſhould not ſo be ſaid that her chyld-bearing vvas vncertaine, or by ſtelth, &amp; this ſhe did for that ſhe vvas paſt the ordinary yeares of conception.

                     <p>THis Signiorie of <hi>Florence</hi> the chief parte of <hi>Tuſcane</hi> is in the hart of <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; in the middeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thereof is the ritche &amp; beautiful cittie of <hi>Florence.</hi> In this cittie in the yeare 1464 died <hi>Coſmo de Medicis</hi> a woorſhipful citizen thereof, from whome the Duke that now poſſeſſeth both the cittie &amp; countrie and his predeceſſors are deſcended.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Coſmo</hi> for his great wiſdome welth &amp; credit was ſuch; that it may be thought there was neuer any priuate man (to wit without ſome tytle of honor) to be vnto him compared. The cittie of <hi>Florence</hi> by the goodly edifices which therin he erected hath bin greatly beautified. The moſte faire &amp; ſumptuous Church of <hi>S. Laurence</hi> he there builded, as alſo the Church of <hi>S. Mark,</hi> &amp; the monaſterie of <hi>S. Verdiana.</hi> He built for himſelf ſo faire a dwelling hows that the beſt maſters in <hi>Architecture</hi> do admyre it. In the <hi>Feſulian hilles</hi> hee built the monaſterie of <hi>S. Hierome;</hi> and another called the <hi>Abbadia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In <hi>Mugelo</hi> he built a monaſterie of <hi>S. Francis.</hi> In <hi>Freſoli Carregi Cafayolo</hi> &amp; <hi>Tribio</hi> (places in the country there abouts) he built 4 magnifical palaces, and in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> he built an hoſpital for pilgrims. He endued the monaſteries which he founded with competent landes &amp; renenues, &amp; the churches with veſſels of gold &amp; ſiluor, faire hanginges, goodly paintinges &amp; ornaments &amp;c. His ſonne after his death peruſing his bookes of accompts did fynd that there was ſcarſly found any one citizen that was not one way or other in his debt And notwithſtanding his great opulence he did not in his porte or apparel beare himſelf otherwiſe then the other citizens, neither maried hee his children or kin folks but among his neighbours &amp; fellow citizens.</p>
                     <p>Thus much I thought good to ad in this place by occaſion of this faire cittie of Florence which is ſo ancient that the name thereof was not vnknowne to <hi>Tacitus Procopius Agathias</hi> &amp; other ancient authors. Touching the ſoile &amp; countrie becauſeit is alredy ſpoken of in this epitome (in the deſcription of Tuſcane) it is heer omitted,</p>

                     <p>APulia otherwiſe called <hi>Terra di Otranto,</hi> is the furtheſt eaſt end of <hi>Italy</hi> &amp; enuyroned with the ſea ſaue where it ioyneth vnto <hi>Terra di Barri,</hi> &amp; apro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vnto <hi>Calabria.</hi> It ſeemeth one of the moſte temperate partes of the world. Corne, frute, &amp; all ſortes of pot-herbes &amp; medicinal herbes are heer moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. The oates may bee compard vnto barley, &amp; the barley vnto wheat of other countries. But the countrie with theaſe extraordinarie good comodities is not exempt from incomodities as extraordinarie euil, for the foile doth heer bring foorth the ſerpent <hi>Tarantola;</hi> whoſe venim is cured by inſtrumental muſic. Here are alſo certaine water-ſerpents and gras-wormes that poiſon and deſtroy the thinges which they touch.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Tarentum</hi> in tymes paſt was a towne of this prouince, ſituated betwene 2 armes of the ſea, &amp; thought impregnable. <hi>Calliopolis</hi> ſtandeth vpon a promontorie ſtretching out into the ſea; with ſo narrow a paſſage vnto it in ſome places that 2 cartes cannot pas together in front. <hi>Hydruntum</hi> which hath a good hauen; is thought to haue bin in tymes paſt the Metropolitaine cittie of all this <hi>Peninſula. Brindezi</hi> is alſo a good &amp; comodious hauen-towne the hauen whereof is chained vp euery night with 2 chaynes of Iron, faſtened vnto the rockes that are on either ſyde.</p>

                     <p>In this Ile in ſomer when the Sun is in the <hi>Tropyk of Cancer</hi> there is no night: &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe in winter no day. The countrie is all ful of high hilles &amp; ſtony iockes, &amp; the people do make themſelues dwellinges in the rock ſydes, &amp; ſome do buyld themſelues cabins of the bones of whales &amp; other fiſhes. Townes &amp; villages are ſcarſe among them, &amp; not a tree is to bee found in the country; neither haue they corne growing there, but the valeys are ſo aboundant in graſſe that they are faine to keep vp their cattel from ouermuch eating; thinking they would els die of to great fatneſſe.</p>
                     <p>They haue wonderful aboundance of fiſh; &amp; much of it they do dry &amp; ſo make it ſtockfiſh. The Ile is deuyded into fowre partes &amp; thoſe according to the foure quarters of the world, eaſt weſt north &amp; ſouth.</p>
                     <p>They are ſubiect vnto the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who yearly ſendeth them a gouernor. There Biſhop (who is of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> religion) they haue in great reuerence.</p>
                     <p>They delight exceedingly in ſonges of the valiant actes of their fore fathers, and euery where in the ſtony rockes the doughty deedes of their predeceſſors are grauen &amp; carued. Sundry of their hilles are ſo high that they are alwayes couered with ſnow, yea ſomtymes the ſnow may bee ſeene on the top of the hil when the foot of it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in flame; of theſe the hil <hi>Hecla</hi> is the chief &amp; it lieth on the weſt ſyde of the Ile. There are alſo 2 other burning hilles, the one is called <hi>Croſberg,</hi> &amp; the other <hi>Helga</hi> and neer vnto mount <hi>Hecla</hi> are heard diuers hideous and ſtrange noiſes.</p>

                     <p>It is deuyded into 3 partes, the firſt whereof conteyneth 2 kingdomes, to wit, of <hi>Miace</hi> &amp; <hi>Amaguco.</hi> In the ſecond part are alſo 2 kingdomes whereof <hi>Bungi</hi> the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal of al; is one, &amp; <hi>Figen</hi> is another. The third parte is deuyded into fowre prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces &amp; lieth betwene the other two partes: and in the kingdomes aforeſaid are many ſeuerall gouernments. The Ile is hilly &amp; ſomwhat cold; &amp; rather vnfruteful then fruteful in diuers places. Howbeit in ſome places they gather in their graine in the moneth of <hi>May,</hi> and their rice in the moneth of <hi>September,</hi> they make no bread of their corne; but a kynde of potage.</p>
                     <p>They haue neither eyle not butter, beaſtes they haue both wyld &amp; tame, but they eat the fleſh of the wyld rather then of the tame: they haue a kynde of auerſion from much ſeeding on fleſh &amp; therefore their greateſt ſuſtenance is ryce &amp; herbes, fiſh they alſo eat, &amp; the fat of fiſh ſerueth them in ſteed of oyle or butter.</p>
                     <p>Two mountaines in this Ile exceed all the other, the one in wonderful heigth, reatching aboue the cloudes the other in caſting foorth flaming fyre.</p>
                     <p>Many of theſe people haue of late yeares (through the preaching of the Ieſuits) receaued the Chriſtian faith, howbeit not al for fome do yet continew in paganiſme, &amp; haue a cuſtome diuers tymes to kil their new borne children, thereby to auoyd the trouble &amp; charge of bringing them vp.</p>
